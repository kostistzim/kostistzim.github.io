<h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; color: #1c5d99;">Introduction</h2> 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> San Francisco has long stood at the intersection of innovation, activism - and social challenges. One of the most persistent is drug and narcotics-related crime.
<br>
<br>

Using official data from the Police Department Incident Reports - Historical, we analysed more than two decades of incident-level data to uncover patterns in when and where drug-related crimes occur. 
<br>
<br>
Focusing specifically on drug and narcotics incidents from 2003 to 2025, we aimed to move beyond stereotypes and uncover the deeper trends that shape the city's crime landscape. 
<br>
<br>
Offences like these can have a negative effect on public safety and how the community feels. They can also be a sign of bigger changes in the law, like the legalisation of cannabis or new ways of policing. We can make it easier to understand how drug crime in San Francisco is changing by using a mix of different types of data and showing it in different ways.</p>


<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: #1c5d99;">When Do Drug/Narcotics Incidents Happen?</h2> 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Drug-related incidents in San Francisco reveal strong temporal patterns — not only in how they’ve changed over the years, but also in the rhythm of days and hours. 
<br>
<br>
As shown in the figure below, reported drug crimes peaked between 2008 and 2010, followed by a sharp and steady decline in the following decade. This drop may reflect a mix of policy changes, such as the legalization of recreational cannabis (in 2010), as well as shifts in enforcement priorities and public health approaches. 
<br>
<br>
Zooming in on time of day, incidents rise steadily in the late morning and peak between 2 PM and 4 PM, tapering off in the evening hours. These patterns could reflect daytime foot traffic, business hours, or police patrol routines. 
<br>
<br>
Weekly trends add another layer: Wednesdays show the highest volume of incidents, with elevated activity midweek and a noticeable drop-off by the weekend. This counters the common assumption that drug crimes are mostly weekend-related, suggesting instead that weekday activity — perhaps linked to routine police operations or community patterns — plays a central role.</p>

<br>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: #1c5d99;">Where Do Drug/Narcotics Incidents Concentrate?</h2> 

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Drug-related incidents in San Francisco are not evenly distributed across the city. Some neighborhoods consistently experience higher volumes, particularly those known for their active nightlife and heavy foot traffic.
<br>
<br>
Figure 2 highlights these spatial patterns, showing how drug and narcotics incidents cluster in areas like the Southern, Tenderloin, and Mission police districts. Darker shading indicates higher incident counts, and these same districts are home to many of the city’s most frequented bars and nightclubs.
<br>
<br>
To visualize this connection, the map also includes markers for popular nightlife venues. A clear overlap emerges: many clubs are located directly within or near the districts with the highest levels of drug-related activity.
<br>
<br>
This relationship likely reflects multiple factors:

<ul>
  <li>Nightlife zones tend to attract dense crowds, creating opportunities for drug transactions or use.</li>
  <li>Heavily policed areas may show higher reporting rates due to increased surveillance.</li>
  <li>Social and economic dynamics — particularly in fast-changing neighborhoods like the Mission — can influence both nightlife trends and illicit activity.</li>
</ul>

While nightlife isn’t necessarily the cause, these overlapping patterns point to shared spaces where multiple urban dynamics intersect. Understanding this geography is crucial for shaping effective public health and safety responses.</p>

">The data reflects a stark contrast between San Francisco’s high-tech innovations and the grim reality faced by neighborhoods such as the Tenderloin. Despite the city’s fame for its tech scene, areas like the Tenderloin remain epicenters for open-air drug markets, as highlighted in both our interactive plot and a recent CNN article. As of 2023, the Tenderloin continues to struggle with alarming overdose death rates, further emphasized by the San Francisco Chronicle's projections of 633 overdose deaths by 2024.
<br>
<br>
This contrast underscores a pressing need for significant policy changes and increased mental health support in San Francisco. In addition to fostering innovation, it is crucial to invest in harm reduction programs and protection for the city's most vulnerable residents.
