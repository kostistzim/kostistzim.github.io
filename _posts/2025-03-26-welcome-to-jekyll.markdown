<h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; color: #1c5d99;">Introduction</h2> 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> San Francisco has long stood at the intersection of innovation, activism - and social challenges. One of the most persistent is drug and narcotics-related crime.
<br>
<br>

Using official data from the Police Department Incident Reports - Historical, we analysed more than two decades of incident-level data to uncover patterns in when and where drug-related crimes occur. 
<br>
<br>
Focusing specifically on drug and narcotics incidents from 2003 to 2025, we aimed to move beyond stereotypes and uncover the deeper trends that shape the city's crime landscape. 
<br>
<br>
Offences like these can have a negative effect on public safety and how the community feels. They can also be a sign of bigger changes in the law, like the legalisation of cannabis or new ways of policing. We can make it easier to understand how drug crime in San Francisco is changing by using a mix of different types of data and showing it in different ways.</p>


<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: #1c5d99;">When Do Drug/Narcotics Incidents Happen?</h2> 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Drug-related incidents in San Francisco reveal strong temporal patterns — not only in how they’ve changed over the years, but also in the rhythm of days and hours. 
<br>
<br>
As shown in the figure below, reported drug crimes peaked between 2008 and 2010, followed by a sharp and steady decline in the following decade. This drop may reflect a mix of policy changes, such as the legalization of recreational cannabis (in 2010), as well as shifts in enforcement priorities and public health approaches. 
<br>
<br>
Zooming in on time of day, incidents rise steadily in the late morning and peak between 2 PM and 4 PM, tapering off in the evening hours. These patterns could reflect daytime foot traffic, business hours, or police patrol routines. 
<br>
<br>
Weekly trends add another layer: Wednesdays show the highest volume of incidents, with elevated activity midweek and a noticeable drop-off by the weekend. This counters the common assumption that drug crimes are mostly weekend-related, suggesting instead that weekday activity — perhaps linked to routine police operations or community patterns — plays a central role.</p>
