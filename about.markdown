We’re Josefine, Sara, and Kostis—three students of DTU united by a shared interest for data and storytelling. While San Francisco is known worldwide for its tech scene, we’re drawn to the city’s deeper realities: Specifically, how different kinds of crimes happened between the years 2003-2025 in the famous city of San Francisco shape its neighborhoods. By gathering and visualizing historical incident reports, we hope to turn raw statistics into a clearer understanding of how,when, where and why crime happens. Thanks for visiting our first website —feel free to explore our visualizations and insights!
